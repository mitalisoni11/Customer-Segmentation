# Customer Segmentation using Kmeans Clustering and RFM Analysis

## Project Overview
This project applies customer segmentation techniques using KMeans clustering, enhanced by RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to gain deeper insights into customer purchasing behavior. By identifying distinct customer groups based on buying patterns, this segmentation helps inform targeted marketing strategies and retention efforts, supporting optimized customer lifetime value.

## Objectives
* Segment customers using KMeans clustering based on purchasing patterns and demographic information.
* Identify key characteristics of each customer group to inform targeted marketing strategies.
* Provide business insights that maximize customer lifetime value and retention.

## Data Preprocessing
* Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and standardize fields.
* Exploratory Analysis: Examine customer attributes and behaviors.

## RFM Analysis:
* Computed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores for each customer to evaluate engagement and value.
* Normalize RFM data to improve clustering accuracy.
* Used RFM scores as key features in the clustering model.

## Clustering with KMeans:
* Conducted KMeans clustering on the RFM-enhanced dataset.
* Used the elbow method and silhouette scores to determine the optimal number of clusters.
* Analyzed and labeled each segment based on behavior patterns.

## Business Recommendations:
* Provided targeted marketing strategies based on segment insights.
* Suggested customer retention strategies for high-value segments and engagement strategies for less active groups.
